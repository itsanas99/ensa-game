## PRESENTATION
```
This work is made by me and zakaria. It's an html5 2D game built with canevas and Javascript I got inspired from the 
early days video games (star wars).The PC version is fully available and running perfectly (it needs a server to run)
I personnally use NodeJs. Just to mention, I'm still working on devices and browsers compatibility (almost there)
the host is available in the link : http://ip172-18-0-49-brt9b6aosm4g00883tk0-80.direct.labs.play-with-docker.com/
A complete documentation will be available as soon as I finish the full version so stay tuned!.
